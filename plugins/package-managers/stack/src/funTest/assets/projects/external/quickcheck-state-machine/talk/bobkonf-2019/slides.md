# Motivation

* Failures can always happen (network issues, I/O failures, processes killed, etc...)
* Problem: when we test our system (rare) failures usually don't happen
* In large scale systems rare failures will happen for sure (the law of large numbers)
* Goal: find bugs related to rare failures before our users!

---

# *Simple Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures* paper [@yuan14]

* The authors studied 198 randomly sampled user-reported failures from five
  distributed systems (Cassandra, HBase, HDFS, MapReduce, Redis)

* "Almost all catastrophic failures (48 in total â€“ 92%) are the result of
  incorrect handling of non-fatal errors explicitly signalled in software."

* Example:
```java
    ... } catch (Exception e) {
      LOG.error(e); // TODO: we should retry here!
    }
```

---

# Overview

* Property based testing (pure/side-effect free/stateless programs)
* State machine modelling (monadic/has side-effect/stateful programs)
* Fault injection (provoking exceptions)
* Examples using
    + [`quickcheck-state-machine`](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/quickcheck-state-machine)
      Haskell library for property based testing
    + The principles are general and tool independent

---

# Recap: property based testing

* Unit tests

```haskell
      test :: Bool
      test = reverse (reverse [1,2,3]) == [1,2,3]

```

* Property based tests

```haskell
      prop_reverse :: [Int] -> Bool
      prop_reverse xs = reverse (reverse xs) == xs
```

. . .

* Running the tests

```haskell
      > quickCheck prop_reverse
      +++ OK, passed 100 tests.

```

---

# Recap: property based testing (bad)


```haskell
prop_bad :: [Int] -> Bool
prop_bad xs = reverse xs == xs


```

. . .

```haskell
> quickCheck prop_bad
*** Failed! Falsifiable (after 5 tests and 2 shrinks):
[0,1]
[1,0] /= [0,1]
```

---

# State machine modelling (somewhat simplified)

* Datatype of actions/commands that users can perform
* A simplified model of the system
* A transition function explaining how the model evolves for each action
* Semantics function that executes the action against the real system
* Post-condition that asserts that the result of execution matches the model

---

# Example: CRUD web application

```haskell
data Action = Create | Read | Update String | Delete

type Model = Maybe String

transition :: Model -> Action -> Model
transition _m Create     = Just ""
transition  m Read       = m
transition _m (Update s) = Just s
transition _m Delete     = Nothing
```

---

# Example: CRUD application (continued)

```haskell
data Response = Unit () | String String

semantics :: Action -> IO Response -- Pseudo code
semantics Create     = Unit   <$> httpReqPost   url
semantics Read       = String <$> httpReqGet    url
semantics (Update s) = Unit   <$> httpReqPut    url s
semantics Delete     = Unit   <$> httpReqDelete url

postcondition :: Model -> Action -> Response -> Bool
postcondition (Just m) Read (String s) = s == m
postcondition _m       _act _resp      = True
```

# State machine modelling counterexample

```haskell
> quickCheck prop_stateMachine
*** Failed! Falsifiable (after 9 tests and 3 shrinks):
[Create, Update "apa", Read]

Nothing
  == Create ==> Unit ()
Just ""
  == Update "apa" ==> Unit ()
Just "apa"
  == Read ==> String ""
Just "apa"
```
```
Postcondition failed for Read, got "" from the system
but expected "apa".
```

# Fault injection

* Many different tools and libraries, none native to Haskell
* We'll use the C library `libfiu` (**f**ault **i**njection in **u**serspace)
* Two modes of operation
    + Inject POSIX API/syscall failures
    + Inject failures at user specified failpoints

---

# Fault injection: syscall failures

* Using `fiu-run` directly:

```bash
      fiu-run -x -c 'enable name=posix/io/*' ls
```

* Via `fiu-ctrl` in a possibly different process:

```bash
      fiu-run -x top

      fiu-ctrl -c "enable  name=posix/io/oc/open" \
          $(pidof top)
      fiu-ctrl -c "disable name=posix/io/oc/open" \
          $(pidof top)
```

---

# Fault injection: user specified failpoints


```c
size_t free_space() {
        fiu_return_on("no_free_space", 0);

        [code to find out how much free space there is]
        return space;
}

bool file_fits(FILE *fd) {
        if (free_space() < file_size(fd)) {
                return false;
        }
        return true;
}
```

```c
fiu_init();
fiu_enable("no_free_space", 1, NULL, 0);
assert(file_fits("tmpfile") == false);
```

# Over-the-air updates

```haskell
data Action = Check | Download | Install | Reboot
            | Inject Fault | DisableFaultInject

data Fault = Network | Kill | GCIOPause | ProcessPrio
           | ReorderReq | SkewClock | RmFile | DamageFile
           | Libfiu (Either Syscall Failpoint)

inject :: Fault -> IO ()  -- Pseudo code
inject Network     = call "iptables -j DROP $IP"
inject Kill        = call "kill -9 $PID"
inject GCIOPause   = call "killall -s STOP $PID"
inject ProcessPrio = call "renice -p $PID"
inject ReorderReq  = call "someproxy" -- Which?
inject SkewClock   = call "faketime $SKEW"
inject RmFile      = call "rm -f $FILE"
inject DamageFile  = call "echo 0 > $FILE"
inject Libfiu      = call "fiu-ctrl -c $FAULT $PID"

```

---

# Over-the-air updates (continued)

```haskell
data Model = Model { fault :: Maybe Fault, ... }

transition :: Model -> Action -> Model
transition m (Fault f)          = m { fault = Just f }
transition m DisableFaultInject = m { fault = Nothing }
transition m ...

postcondition :: Model -> Action -> Response -> Bool
postcondition m act resp = case (fault m, act) of
  (Nothing,      Download) -> resp == Ok
  (Just Network, Download)
      -> resp == TimeoutError
  (Just (Libfiu (Right InstallFailure)), Install)
      -> resp == FailedToInstallError
  ...
```

---

# Over-the-air updates (continued 2)

```haskell
prop_reliable :: Property
prop_reliable = forAllActions $ \acts -> do
  (device, update) <- setup
  scheduleUpdateToDevice update device
  let model = initModel { device = Just device }
  (model', result) <- runActions acts model
  assert (result == Success) -- Post-conditions hold
  runActions [ DisableFaultInject
             , Check, Download, Install, Reboot ]
             model'
  update' <- currentUpdate device
  assert (update' == update) -- Always able to recover
```

# Adjoint Inc's `libraft`

* Raft is a consensus algorithm
* Simplified: how do we get a bunch of nodes to agree on a value?
* Simplified:
    1. The nodes elect a leader
    2. All requests get forwarded to the leader
    3. Leader makes sure changes get propagated to the followers
* Complications (faults we inject):
    + Network traffic loss
    + Nodes joining and parting
    + Network partitions
    + ...

# Summary

* Exceptional circumstances are by definition rare and hence less likely to be
  tested

* Exceptional circumstances are often edge cases and hence less likely to be
  considered when writing the program

* Exceptional circumstances will nevertheless occur in any long running system

* By combining fault injection with property based testing we force ourselves to
  consider these exceptional cases, before our users report them as a bug!
